# journal
This is a journal app built with Flutter and connected to Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. Users can create daily journals including the date, note, and mood. The app allows users to edit, delete, and add journals. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Flutter, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Firestore.
